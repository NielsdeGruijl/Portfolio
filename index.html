                                I made this project for a school subject, it was my first solo Unity project, the gamejam has taught me a lot about the core of unity which really helped starting off with this project.
                                <br><br>
                                It's not really a game and more a project to practice making an FPS controller. It's basically a target range with 2 levels, the first has static target dummies, 
                                the second has moving variants. I learned a lot during the development of this project, I now have a basic understanding of the core Unity API and FPS controllers.

                                Chef Cat was a school project, 2 engineers, 3 artists and 2 designers were involved. It's a puzzle game where you need to help a falling cat collect all the ingredients in order to make
                                some lasagna.
                                <br><br>
                                During this project I was mainly responsible for setting up the levels and animations. We encountered a lot of Git problems due to a poor setup of our GitKraken. During the gamejam
                                I learned about branching in Git which will hopefully help preventing these situations in the future.

                                <h3>Retired (gamejam 2021)</h3>
                                This project was made in Unity during my first ever gamejam hosted by my study. It was made by a team of 4 engineers and 2 artists, it was also my first ever time working with Unity!
                                <br><br>
                                The gamejam lasted 48 hours and I mainly spent that time on figuring out Unity itself. I worked on some UI elements like a "happiness bar" (health bar equivalent) and gave an inventory
                                system a shot, though not much came from that. I also learned a lot about branching in Git.
